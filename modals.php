        <p>MyCopie is a very private notebook. All the contents of your MyCopie notebooks will be completely safe. But, 80% of the students who use it don't care about their privacy because they anyways are not taking notes properly, despite our continuous efforts. But, still, this is the MOST private notebooks you will find. Not even CIA can crack into our secured notebooks.This is unlike any other notebooks and the technology behind it will be a closely guarded secret till we actually find it ourselves.</p>

        <p>What makes you think we have job opportunities? If we had any serious job, don't you think we would be doing them already?
       But, anyways, since you are here and also because you look like a very genuine person, mail us your CV along with your friend's picture to jobless@mycopie.com. Mind you, we don't like CVs. So, be very casual about the contents and make sure there are plenty of images customized for color blind. The moment we receive your CV, we will hire a Recruiter who will then call you to hire you. Once you are hired, you are not supposed to make us work. If you do, we will report to your parents. If you still make us work, We might have to reach your Principal or Correspondent who probably wouldn't know you exist.

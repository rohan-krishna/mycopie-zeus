	<li> 9000 Cr worth of notebooks were sold in India last year. That's a lot of notebooks, don't you think? </li>
	<li> Yet the only two recognizable brands in this space are ITC(Classmate) and Navneet. Together they only have 25% market share. The remaining 75% is still controlled by smaller regional players. </li>
	<li> The notebooks today are completely boring and uninspiring, even from ITC. They don't resonate with student's lifestyle or taste. MyCopie is making giant strides in that direction and  has seen huge success already in the locations it has presence. </li>
	<li> We make brilliant designs, load the notebooks with exciting coupons, embed augmented reality games and many other innovations which makes MyCopie the coolest brand for  youngsters. We see absolutely no threat from any bigger companies and are sure to become the fastest growing company in this segment in coming years. </li>
	<li> We need distributors who are aggressive and share this vision of bringing awesome notebooks to college students of this generation. You will enjoy tremendous business success  and an exciting relationship with us. </li>
